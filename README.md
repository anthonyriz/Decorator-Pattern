# Decorator-Pattern
In this lab, I was provided a main driver code for a pizza. I was also provided abstract classes, one being for the pizza and one being for the toppings. My task was to implement multiple concrete classes that print a description of a margherita pizza with multiple toppings and the price.

Margherita Pizza, mushrooms, pepperoni
